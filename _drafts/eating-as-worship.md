# Eating as Worship

There is a correlation between body and spirit.

The church is fat and seemingly ok with it. This is a hidden, or rather accepted sin.

Discipline and self-control get easier with time but **never** go away or become automatic.

We are under authority. Heb 6... Moses waited patiently to receive the promise.

Parallels bewtween Faith and Food

  - We contribute nothing to being alive (as with Grace)
  - We choose how to respond to the gift of life (Sanctification)
      - Sow vs reap
      - Culivate patience
      - Consistency
      - Spirit Led
      - This is a hard, sweaty process
  - Physical neglect has spiritual consequences and vice versa
  - Drinking or eating too much results in letting guard down. Self/sin creeps in and takes over
    - Mind wanders
    - Unfocused
    - Satan exploits
    -
Fast is simply time not eating. We all do it everyday.

Discipline sets the stage for God to appear. It removes distractions.

The first sin was eating.
