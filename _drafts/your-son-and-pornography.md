# Your Son and Pornography

This is a very practical post for those with kids. I've long waged my own war against lust and pornography. The sheer accessibility and depth of twistedness that is available today on every device is staggering. It's hard enough to deal with keeping your own mind and heart clean. It's quite another to raise your children in the middle of the battle for their mind.

I have a 15 year old son. The battle for his heart and mind is difficult, exhausting, and essential. We started having conversation five years ago or so about how God views sex. It's amazing. God created it. He wants us to enjoy it in the context he provides for us: marriage. One man and one woman sharing a life-long commitment to one another.

For a number of years, I'd ask him about lust, temptation, pornography,and masturbation. I want to have a non-shaming dialogue to walk alongside him as a brother in Christ. I want him to understand that sin is real and dangerous but also that God loves us and wants to transform our lowly desires toward eternal ones.

> It would seem that Our Lord finds our desires not too strong, but too weak. We are half-hearted creatures, fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us, like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea. We are far too easily pleased.

There are many fronts to this battle. The first is overcoming my own fear and being appropriately vulnerable with my past *and present* struggles and failures. It's too convenient to simply leave that out. This means engaging him in conversation, pursuing him when he just wants to play video games, and creating opportunities to spend time together.

Another front is navigating difficult conversions. It's tough to ask about specifics. "How's your thought life?" is much easier than "Are you masturbating?" Specifics are what my dad didn't ask me about. He potentially could have saved me from many bad choices. What I've found helpful is to ask about the specifics but without judgment or a tone of shaming. This is a battle we all must wage to one degree or another. We are on this journey together.

The last area to consider is accountability. This is a two-headed dragon. The first head is limiting access. Being a tech nerd, there are ways around most filters or the filters don't work consistently. I used OpenDNS which helped to limit direct access to porn sites but it didn't filter Google image search without completely blocking Google. That's the easiest gateway to porn and it's wide open. If you turn on safe mode in the browser and then open an Incognito window, it's turned off again.

Thankfully, after a couple months of failed searches, I discovered [cleanbrowsing.org](http://cleanbrowsering.org). IT IS AMAZING. A handful to tech dads got together and solved this problem. *And it's free.*
